    Conditions of use for discount codes
    Discount codes ("Coupons") may be applied to pre-paid hotel bookings, excluding bookings at non-participating hotels
    whose list will be made available along with each specific Coupon.
    Participating hotels are subject to change at any time.
    Coupons with a discount in a specific currency (e.g. 10 Euro off) cannot be used for bookings paid for in a different
    currency.
    <br><br>
    If the discount is based on a percentage (e.g. 10% off), in case of booking of multiple rooms (i.e., when you books 2 or
    more rooms in the same booking) the discount only applies to the price of the first room included in the booking
    request.<br>
    For specific restrictions on use of Coupons please see the relevant Coupon communication.
    Only one Coupon per booking may be used. Usual booking terms and conditions apply and all bookings are subject to
    availability. Coupons cannot be sold or transferred.
    <br><br>
    All taxes, fees, charges, and surcharges are applicable to reservations made using Coupons. These charges must be paid
    at the time of the reservation or directly at the hotel and are your responsibility. Coupons have value only when
    redeemed in accordance with all terms and conditions of the offer. Coupons cannot be returned for cash or its
    equivalent.
    <br><br>
    Single-use Coupons will be deemed fully used once a qualifying reservation has been made and will not be returned or
    replaced and there will be no refund if a Coupon is redeemed in part. Multiple-use Coupons will be deemed fully used in
    accordance with the restrictions set out in the individual Coupon terms and conditions.
    <br><br>
    If the travel stay dates are changed after the use of a Coupon, then that Coupon will not apply to the changed travel
    schedule. Coupons may not be used for any previously purchased reservation.
    Coupons cannot be used by travel agencies affiliated to the Hotels.com travel agency program.
    Hotels.com reserves the right to vary these conditions of use or to withdraw Coupons at any time.
    <br><br>
    TERMS, CONDITIONS AND WARRANTIES
    <br><br>
    Tax Recovery Charge
    <br><br>
    The tax charge on Hotels.com Special Internet Rate hotel transactions is a recovery of all applicable transaction taxes
    (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that Hotels.com pays to the vendors (e.g.
    hotels, etc.) in connection with your travel arrangements.
    <br><br>
    Hotels.com is not the vendor collecting and remitting said tax to the applicable tax authorities. The vendors bill all
    applicable taxes to Hotels.com and Hotels.com remits such tax directly to the vendor. Hotels.com is not a co-vendor
    associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements.
    <br><br>
    Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. Hotel.com's actual tax cost paid to the vendor may
    vary from the tax recovery charge, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of
    the hotel, automobile, etc. by our customer.
    <br><br>
    Service Fee
    <br><br>
    We retain service fees as compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Service fees vary based on the amount and
    type of hotel reservation.
    <br><br>
    PAY NOW ONLINE OR PAY LATER AT HOTEL DETAILS
    <br><br>
    With certain hotels, you may be presented with the option to pay online immediately or to pay later at the hotel itself.
    If you select the option to pay online immediately, you will be charged the amount in the currency that you select
    immediately The company taking that payment and charging your credit card will be either: (1) Travel Partner Exchange or
    another member of the Hotels.com Companies doing business as Hotels.com, taking such payment on behalf of the travel
    service provider, or (2) the travel service provider directly. âTPXâ means Travel Partner Exchange S.L. whose registered
    office is Calle Villalba Hervas 9, Planta 8, 38002 Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain
    <br><br>
    If you select to pay later at the hotel itself, the hotel will charge you in the local currency of the relevant hotel at
    the time of your stay. Tax rates and foreign exchange rates could change in the time between booking and stay. You shall
    provide the details of your payment card and the supplier or Hotels.com will often have to verify: (i) the validity of
    the payment card (through a charge of a nominal value that is either refunded within a few days or deducted from the
    final payment due to the supplier) and, (ii) the availability of funds on the payment card (to be confirmed by the bank
    issuing your credit card). Hotels.com reserves the right to cancel your booking if full payment is not received in a
    timely fashion (please see Supplier Rules and Restrictions).<br>
    Many bank and credit card companies charge their account holders a transaction fee when the card issuer and the merchant
    location (as defined by the card brand (e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express) are in different countries. The
    currency exchange rate, if applicable, and any transaction fee are determined solely by the bank or other agency
    processing the transaction. These fees may be applied by the card issuer as a charge to the cardholders account. This
    means the amount listed on your credit or debit card statement may be a different figure than the figure shown on the
    billing summary page for a reservation booked on this Website. If you have any questions about these fees or any
    exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.
    FLIGHTS, PACKAGES AND OTHER ACTIVITIES
    <br><br>
    The bookings of standalone flights, package holidays (flight + accommodation) and other activities offered on the
    Hotels.comâs âFlight Onlyâ, âFlight + Hotelâ and âThings to doâ tab (https://travel.uk.hotels.com/Packages-Flights) are

    <br><br>
    LINKED TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS STANDARD INFORMATION FORM
    <br><br>
    Important information regarding Linked Travel Arrangements
    'Linked Travel Arrangementâ means the same as the definition of a âlinked travel arrangementâ in the Directive (EU)
    2015/2302 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on Package Travel and Linked Travel
    Arrangements as may be implemented into national law (âDirective (EU) 2015/2302â).
    In certain circumstances, a Linked Travel Arrangement may be formed as a result of travel services you decide to book
    from other companies. Where this possibility arises, you will be directed to read the important information below.
    <br><br>
    If, after selecting and paying for one travel service, you book additional travel services for your trip or holiday via
    Hotels.com, you will NOT benefit from rights applying to packages under Directive (EU) 2015/2302.
    <br><br>
    Therefore, Hotels.com will not be responsible for the proper performance of those additional travel services. In case of
    problems please contact the relevant service provider.
    <br><br>
    However, if you book additional travel services not later than 24 hours after receiving the confirmation of the hotel
    booking from Hotels.com, those travel services will become part of a linked travel arrangement. In that case Hotels.com
    has, as required by EU law, protection in place to refund your payments to Hotels.com for services not performed because
    of Hotels.com's insolvency. Please note that if any of your payments go directly to the relevant travel service provider
    Hotels.com has not taken any protection to refund you in the event of the insolvency of the relevant service provider.
    More information on insolvency protection is set out below:
    <br><br>
    Hotels.com has taken out insolvency protection by way of an insurance with International Passenger Protection Limited
    and underwritten by certain underwriters at Lloydâs Syndicates, for any monies paid directly to Hotels.com. Travellers
    may contact International Passenger Protection Limited (Claims Office, IPP House, 22-26 Station Road, West Wickham,
    Kent, BR4 0PR, Tel +31 103120666, Email: Insolvency-claims@ipplondon.co.uk) if the services are denied because of
    Hotels.com's insolvency.
    <br><br>
    Note: This insolvency protection does not cover contracts with parties other than Hotels.com, which can be performed
    despite Hotels.com's insolvency.
    <br><br>
    The Directive (EU) 2015/2302 is available here https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/NIM/?uri=CELEX:32015L2302

    <br><br>
    PRICES
    <br><br>
    The price of the travel services will be as quoted on the website from time to time, except in cases of obvious error.
    Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect bookings already accepted. Despite Hotels.comâs
    best efforts, some of the travel services listed on the website may be incorrectly priced. HOTELS.COM EXPRESSLY RESERVES
    THE RIGHT TO CORRECT ANY PRICING ERRORS ON OUR WEBSITE AND/OR ON PENDING RESERVATIONS MADE UNDER AN INCORRECT PRICE. IN
    SUCH EVENT, IF AVAILABLE, WE WILL OFFER YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP YOUR PENDING RESERVATION AT THE CORRECT PRICE OR WE
    WILL CANCEL YOUR RESERVATION WITHOUT PENALTY. Hotels.com is under no obligation to provide travel services to you at an
    incorrect (lower) price, even after you have been sent confirmation of your booking.
    <br><br>
    You acknowledge that Hotels.com pre-negotiates certain room rates with hotel suppliers to facilitate the booking of
    reservations. You also acknowledge that Hotels.com provides you services to facilitate such booking of reservations for
    a consideration (the "facilitation fee"). The room rate displayed on the Website is a combination of the pre-negotiated
    room rate for rooms reserved on your behalf by Hotels.com, and the facilitation fee retained by Hotels.com for their
    services. You authorize Hotels.com to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate
    displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges, service fees, and where applicable, taxes on the Hotels.com
    services. You agree that your credit card will be charged by Hotels.com for the total reservation price. Upon submitting
    your reservation request you authorize Hotels.com, including Travelscape, LLC or Travel Partner Exchange, S.L. (TPX), to
    facilitate hotel reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with hotel suppliers.

    <br><br>
    HOW WE DISPLAY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON HOTELS.COM
    <br><br>
    Travelers have many options on Hotels.com to help them find the perfect hotel. The âsortâ settings allow travellers to
    order search results to their preference, whether based on price, verified review score, or other criteria. The âfilterâ
    settings also allow travellers to include or exclude various options to suit their travel needs. If no options are
    selected, Hotels.com will show a range of relevant options in the search results, based on the criteria outlined below.
    In our default sort of âOur Favouritesâ, the sort order reflects the relevance of properties to your search criteria, as
    we want to make sure you are able to quickly and easily find the offer that is right for you. We measure relevance by
    taking into account factors like a propertyâs location, its review scores, the popularity of the property (measured by
    how many travellers on our sites make bookings at that property), the quality of the content provided by the property,
    and the competitiveness of the propertyâs rates and availability, all relative to other properties meeting your chosen
    search criteria. The compensation which a property pays us for bookings made through our sites is also a factor for the
    relative ranking of properties with similar offers, based on the relevance factors described above. On our non-default
    sorts (e.g., by price or by star rating), properties with similar results will be ordered based on the factors above.
    <br><br>
    Additionally, Hotels.com continually optimizes our service to provide the best experience to travellers. Accordingly, we
    may test different default sort order algorithms from time to time.

    <br><br><br><br>
    CHANGES OR CANCELLATIONS
    <br><br><br><br>
    You can change or cancel your lodging booking either online under your Reservations when signed into your Hotels.com
    account, by emailing our customer services at help@hotels.com, or by calling us on 0800 783 2390 or 0203 027 6612 from a
    mobile.<br>
    You can change your guest name, bed type, smoking preference, special requests, accessibility options, room type, number
    of guests and travel dates at no charge to you by Hotels.com. Lodging suppliers may impose other change and/or
    cancellation fees. Charges vary by reservation, so please review your confirmation email for details.
    You agree to pay any supplier required cancellation or change fees that you incur. In limited cases, some hotels do not
    permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after they are made, as indicated in the rules and restrictions for
    the hotel reservation. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions imposed with respect to your prepaid hotel
    reservations.<br>
    You do not have an automatic right to cancellation unless such rights are provided by hotels under their specific rules
    and restrictions which are provided to you prior to booking. In the event that a hotel is unable to honour your booking,
    Hotels.com will not be liable for any cost incurred due to relocation.
    If you do not show for the first night of your reservation but plan to check-in for subsequent nights in the
    reservation, you must confirm the reservation with Hotels.com no later than the original date of check-in to prevent
    cancellation of the whole booking. If you do not confirm the booking changes with Hotels.com the whole booking may be
    cancelled and refunds will only be due to you in line with the Rules and Restrictions of the particular hotel, as
    notified in the booking process.<br>
    These terms and conditions may not be changed by any unauthorized person, including employees of Hotels.com.

    we can add the Stamps you collect to your account after your stay. If you make a booking with us by phone, you must tell
    us the email address on your account so we know where to add the Stamps. Only Hotels.com Rewards members collect Stamps.
    Other guests on the same booking do not, and you cannot collect Stamps for any hotel bookings you made before you joined
    the Program.
    <br><br>
    We will add any Stamps you collect to your account up to 72 hours after you check out of the Hotels.com Rewards
    property. If you collect Stamps but we later believe that you did not complete your hotel stay (an âInvalid Stampâ), we
    reserve the right to remove these Invalid Stamps from your account. This could happen if you cancel your booking or did
    not turn up at the hotel, which would make the Stamps invalid.
    <br><br>
    Invalid Stamps do not count towards the 10 Stamps you need to redeem a Reward Night.

    <br><br><br>
    You can check your account to see how many Stamps you have collected at any time. Just sign in at Hotels.com, use our
    mobile app, or phone our call centre. You are responsible for making sure your account is correct. If you believe that
    you have not collected the correct amount of Stamps, we will look into this for you. If any bookings are invalid as
    mentioned earlier, we will remove them from your account.

    <br><br><br>
    In addition to the information above, you will not collect Stamps for the following:<br>
    1. Bookings made with an affiliate Hotels.com site<br>
    2. Bookings made before you joined the Program<br>
    3. Package bookings i.e. hotel + flight<br>
    4. Some bookings made using a discount coupon, voucher or code â you will need to check the terms for each of these<br>
    5. Bookings made through Group Travel Services<br>
    6. Bookings that do not cost you anything, i.e. are free<br>
    <br><br>
    REDEEMING REWARD NIGHTS
    <br><br>
    When you collect 10 Stamps, we will give you 1 Reward Night to redeem at any eligible Hotels.com Rewards property. You
    can redeem your Reward Night online and on our mobile app.
    <br><br>
    The maximum value of your Reward Night is based on the value of the 10 Stamps you collected as long as they have not
    expired. This value is equal to the average daily rate, excluding taxes and fees, of the Stamps you previously
    collected. If you collected a Stamp at a Hotels.com Secret Price (defined below), this price rather than the regular
    price will be used for the purposes of the calculation. You must pay for taxes, fees, meals and any other costs
    associated with your Reward Night. You must also pay the Redemption Fee when you redeem your Reward Night on our
    desktop/mobile web site. You will not be charged a Redemption Fee when you redeem your Reward Night on our mobile app.
    <br><br>
    If you used different currencies when collecting your 10 Stamps, the value of each Stamp is currently calculated using
    the currency associated with the territory you were in when you joined the Program.
    <br><br>
    Reward Night stays are subject to all applicable booking terms and conditions. You will not collect a Stamp when you
    redeem your Reward Night. Stamps have no cash value, and you cannot redeem your Reward Night for cash.
    <br><br>
    If you redeem your Reward Night on a stay that is less than the maximum value of your Reward Night, you will not get the
    difference in cash, credit or anything else. You can redeem your Reward Night on a stay that costs more than the maximum
    value of your Reward Night â you just pay the difference.
    <br><br>
    If you have more than 1 Reward Night to redeem, you can choose which booking you want to apply it to. If you opt to use
    multiple Reward Nights on the same booking you will be charged a Redemption Fee for each Reward Night you redeem. You
    cannot combine your Reward Night with any other offer, discount coupon, voucher or code, unless the terms for each of
    these say you can. This means that when you book a stay and redeem your Reward Night, you generally will not be able to
    get an additional discount on that booking.

    <br><br>
    If you redeem your Reward Night on a booking that is longer than 1 night, we will automatically apply its value to the
    most expensive night in that booking, subject to its maximum value.
    <br><br>
    Reward Night stays are subject to all applicable cancellation policies that are passed onto us by the Hotels.com Rewards
    property. If you cancel a Reward Night for which, had you paid for the booking and cancelled it you would have been
    entitled to a full refund, we will return the Reward Night to your account and refund any Redemption Fee. If you cancel
    a Reward Night for which, had you paid for the booking and cancelled it you would have been entitled to a 1-99% refund,
    the Reward Night will not be returned to your account but we will return to you any Redemption Fee. If you cancel a
    Reward Night for which, had you paid for the booking and cancelled it you would have not been entitled to any refund,
    the Reward Night will not be returned to your account and any Redemption Fee will not be refunded to you.
    <br><br>
    If you want to change the dates of a booking that includes the Reward Night you redeemed, you will need to cancel the
    booking, wait for the Reward Night to be returned to your account, then rebook so you can apply your Reward Night to
    your new booking.
    <br><br>
    HOTELS.COM REWARDS TIERS
    <br><br>
    The Program has 3 tiers: Hotels.com Rewards, Hotels.com Rewards Silver and Hotels.com Rewards Gold. You will join as a
    Hotels.com Rewards member. When you collect 10-29 Stamps in a membership year, you will qualify for Hotels.com Rewards
    Silver. When you collect 30 Stamps or more in a membership year, you will qualify for Hotels.com Rewards Gold. A
    membership year runs for a year from the date you first created an account, and each anniversary after that.

    <br><br><br>
    Silver and Gold members have a dedicated phone number they can call 24/7 to make or discuss their bookings. And there
    are other benefits like early sale access and exclusive offers. These will all be available within 2 weeks of qualifying
    for Silver or Gold, and will last for the rest of that membership year and the whole of the following membership year.
    If you do not collect enough Stamps to stay in Silver or Gold, we will move you down a tier for the next membership
    year.
    <br><br>
    CHANGES AND TERMINATION
    <br><br>
    Your Stamps will not expire as long as you keep your account active at least once every 12 months. This means you must
    collect a Stamp or redeem a Reward Night in that time, and when you do, the expiry date will be extended for another 12
    months. If you do not collect Stamps or redeem Reward Nights in a 12 month period, your Stamps will expire and we may
    deactivate your account. If this happens, your Stamps will not be reissued. Sign into your account to check when your
    Stamps are due to expire.

    <br><br><br>
    We may change our terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice, including the rules for collecting nights,
    the different membership tiers and their qualification requirements and associated benefits, the rules for redeeming
    your Reward Night, the list of eligible Hotels.com Rewards properties, and the maximum value of a Reward Night. We may
    communicate these changes to you by email or on our Hotels.com website so please make sure you check your account
    regularly.
    <br><br>
    Hotels.com Rewards has no end date and will continue until we close it, which could happen at any time. If we do close
    the Program, you will have 30 days from when we announce its closure to redeem any Reward Nights you have in your
    account. After that date, you will lose your Reward Nights and you will not be compensated.
    By continuing to collect Stamps and redeem Reward Nights with Hotels.com Rewards, you accept any changes to these terms
    and conditions. You are responsible for keeping up to date on any changes that we may make. The most current version
    will always be available on our website.
    <br><br>
    General Hotels.com Rewards Terms & Conditions
    <br><br>
    We reserve the right to discontinue your membership if you act fraudulently or use our loyalty program in a way that
    does not comply with our terms and conditions, or any federal or state laws, regulations, statutes or ordinances. If we
    discontinue your membership, you may lose your collected Stamps and benefits. We also have the right to take appropriate
    administrative and/or legal action, including criminal prosecution if necessary.
    <br><br>
    While you are signed up to Hotels.com Rewards, we may communicate any updates to your account or transactions to you by
    email. We may take back your Stamps at any time. You cannot sell or transfer your Stamps, or combine them with another
    memberâs Stamps. Stamps and Reward Nights are not transferable if a member dies, if there is a domestic relations issue,
    or otherwise by operation of law. You agree that all disputes, claims and causes of action like these are resolved
    individually exclusively by the appropriate court of England and Wales.
    <br><br>
    If you have any questions about these terms and conditions or your rights and obligations, these will be governed, and
    construed in accordance with, the laws of England and Wales.
    The Program is void where prohibited by law. Our failure to enforce any provision of these terms and conditions shall
    not constitute a waiver of that or any other provision. Our decision on all questions or disputes regarding the Program
    is final.

    PRICE GUARANTEE TERMS
    <br><br>
    Price Guarantee - If you find a lower rate on Hotels.com or on another website by 23:59 local time the day before your
    stay, we will offer you the difference. Package reservations are not eligible for this guarantee, and other terms and
    conditions apply, as per the below.
    <br><br>
    Submitting a Claim -<br>
    â¢ For non-refundable bookings: Hotels.com will compensate you by issuing a coupon with a value corresponding to the
    price difference. The coupon can be used on a future booking on the Hotels.com site. You must contact the customer call
    centre or submit your request using the online Price Guarantee form by 23:59 local time the day before your stay. The
    room with the lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service
    representatives.<br>
    â¢ For refundable bookings:<br>
    a) Where the cheaper rate is found on Hotels.com: You can either call the customer call centre by 23:59 local time the
    day before your stay or cancel your existing booking online under Your Bookings when signed into your Hotels.com account
    and rebook online at the cheaper price. If you call us, the room with the lower rate must be available for booking at
    the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives. At your request, the customer service
    representative will rebook the room found at the lower rate using the payment details that you give on the phone. Your
    original booking will be cancelled by our customer service representative, and you will receive a refund for the price
    originally paid. Refunds will be processed by Hotels.com immediately, but your bank can take up to 30 days to process
    the refund.<br>
    b) Where the cheaper rate is found on a competitorâs site: Hotels.com will refund the price difference. You must contact
    the customer call centre or submit your request using the online Price Guarantee form by 23:59 local time the day before
    your stay. The room with the lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our
    customer service representatives. Refunds will be processed by Hotels.com upon verification of your request, but your
    bank can take up to 30 days to process the refund.
    <br><br>
    Comparison must be to same itinerary - The Price Guarantee is available only for exact itinerary matches, including
    property, room type, applicable cancellation policy, and dates of travel as booked through hotels.com. In addition, the
    comparison must be to the same property purchased stand-alone through another website. In other words, properties booked
    on another website as part of a package will not be eligible for the Price Guarantee. The Price Guarantee applies to the
    cost of booked travel, as presented on your booking confirmation, including any taxes and fees collected by us from you
    at the time of booking. The Price Guarantee does not apply to any taxes or fees collected by any third party from you,
    such as those taxes and fees a hotel may collect directly from you when you stay at the hotel. The Price Guarantee is
    not available for bookings on websites where the property or other booking details are unknown until after purchase. You
    must meet all requirements imposed on the lower price (if any), including, without limitation, residency, regional and
    age-related requirements.
    <br><br>
    Comparison must be available to the general public - The Price Guarantee applies only to prices both advertised and
    available to the general public. It also applies to our Secret Prices. The Price Guarantee does not apply to rates
    offered on competitors' membership program websites; corporate discounts or rates; group, charter, rewards program,
    incentive, meeting, convention, consolidator or interline prices; prices obtained via auction or similar process; or
    prices available only by using a coupon or other promotion not offered to the general public. The lower rate may not
    come from a website where you call to get the rate, or from an e-mail that you received.
    <br><br>
    Claim Verification - All requests are subject to verification by hotels.com. We will not accept screenshots or other
    purported evidence of a lower price that we cannot independently confirm. Nor will we verify any request that we
    believe, in our sole discretion, is the result of a printing or other error or is made fraudulently or in bad faith.
    <br><br>
    Refunds for Verified Requests (for refundable bookings only) - Verified refund requests will receive a credit to the
    card used for the reservation. Where you have paid for your hotel at the time of booking, we will send your refund upon
    verification of your request. Where you have chosen to pay for your Hotels.com booking later at the hotel and you have
    found the cheaper price on another website, you must pay the hotel the original price upon arrival and we will send your
    refund after you have completed your stay. Note, any refunds may take up to 30 days or the next billing cycle to appear
    on your statement.
    <br><br>
    Coupons (for non-refundable bookings only) - Coupons will be sent to you by email immediately after your request has
    been made and verified by Hotels.com. Coupon terms and conditions will apply (see above under âConditions of use for
    discount codesâ).
    <br><br>
    Changes - We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify or discontinue the Price Guarantee or to restrict its
    availability to any person, at any time, for any or no reason, and without prior notice or liability to you. The terms
    that are in effect at the time of your booking will determine your eligibility under the Price Guarantee. Our failure to
    enforce any provision of these Terms & Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.
