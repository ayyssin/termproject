                Beware of phone call scams
            </div>
            <div class="FAQ-descr">
                Have you received an automated phone call claiming that you’ve won a prize from a well-known travel
                company?
                This is a scam. Hang up and do not give the caller any information.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What it is</b>
                <br>

                The scammers typically use “spoofing” technology to make the incoming telephone number falsely appear to
                originate from a local area code.
                Calls usually begin with a pre-recorded message claiming the caller is a well-known travel company, and
                promising the recipient has “won” some type of prize or discount off travel services. These prizes,
                which
                are also fake, can range from cash cards, trips, or credit for future travel.

                The phone calls can be quite convincing, since the callers take steps to hide their identity and pretend
                to
                represent established businesses or organizations. However, the information you provide (such as name
                and
                address, payment information, or a social security number) goes directly to the criminal, who can then
                use
                the information to his or her own advantage.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What you can do</b>
                <br>
                We will never call or send an email asking for your password or other personal information. If you think
                you
                have received a fraudulent phone call:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hang up. Do not engage with the caller. Take note of the number displayed (if available) and any
                        other identifying information the caller provided.
                    </li>
                    <li>Report the scam to the authorities. Whether about this scam or others, your report can help
                        identify
                        patterns of fraud and abuse.

                Beware of email scams
            </div>
            <div class="FAQ-descr">
                Phishing is a scam where a criminal sends an email asking for personal information, and attempts to
                trick the recipient into responding by clicking on a link, opening an attachment, or directly providing
                sensitive information.
                <br>
                The emails can be quite convincing, since they appear to come from established businesses or
                organizations, and sometimes even link to legitimate-looking websites. However, the information you
                provide—such as a social security or credit card number—goes directly to the criminal, who can then use
                the information to his or her own advantage.
